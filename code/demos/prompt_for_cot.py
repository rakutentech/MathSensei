Question: An amusement park charges an entry fee of $\\$2.25$ plus $\\$1.50$ for each ride. If Simon spent a total of $\\$12.75$, how many rides did he pay for?
Solution:
Let's think step by step. The money left after paying entry fee is $12.75 - $2.25 = $10.50$. Hence, he took $10.50 รท $1.50 = 7$ rides.
Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{7}$.


Question: Walter, Agnes, and Holly are making beaded lizards. Walter has 476 green beads and 32 red beads. Agnes has 104 green beads and 16 red beads. Holly has 281 green beads and 80 red beads. They all share their beads so as to make the largest possible number of lizards.  If a beaded lizard requires 94 green beads and 16 red beads, what is the number of green beads left over?
Solution:
Let's think step by step. The total number of green beads are $476 + 104 + 281 = 861$.The total number of red beads are $32 + 16 + 80 = 128$.
The number of lizards they can make is $min(861 รท 94, 128 รท 16) = 8$.So, the green beads left over are $861 - 8 * 94 = 109$.
Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{109}$.



Question: Rectangle $ABCD$ is the base of pyramid $PABCD$. If $AB = 3$, $BC = 2$, $\\overline{PA}\\perp \\overline{AD}$, $\\overline{PA}\\perp \\overline{AB}$, and $PC = 5$, then what is the volume of $PABCD$?
Solution:
Let's think step by step. The area of the base is $3 * 2 = 6$. The height is $\sqrt{5^2 - \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2}^2} = \sqrt{12}$.Thus the volume is $\frac{1}{3} * 6 * \sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt{12}$.
Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{\\frac{2}{\sqrt{12}}}.


Question: How many of the following numbers are factors of 34 or multiples of 7?\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 14, 17, 29, 56, 91
Solution:
Let's think step by step. The factors of 34 in the list: 1, 2, 17. The multiples of 7 in the list: 14, 56, 91.Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{6}$.
