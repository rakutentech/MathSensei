Question: Find the number of positive integers $n \\ge 3$ that have the following property: If $x_1,$ $x_2,$ $\\dots,$ $x_n$ are real numbers such that $x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_n = 0,$ then\n\\[x_1 x_2 + x_2 x_3 + \\dots + x_{n - 1} x_n + x_n x_1 \\le 0.\\]
Knowledge Retrieval:
- The question also involves understanding of mathematical sequences and series, specifically the concept of the sum of a series of numbers. 
- The condition given in the question, $x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n = 0,$ is a constraint that the sum of all the real numbers $x_1,$ $x_2,$ $\dots,$ $x_n$ is equal to zero.
- The inequality $x_1 x_2 + x_2 x_3 + \dots + x_{n - 1} x_n + x_n x_1 \le 0$ is another constraint that the sum of the product of consecutive numbers in the sequence, plus the product of the last and the first number, is less than or equal to zero.
Solution:
- The inequality holds true for $n = 3$ and $n = 4$.
- For $n > 4$, we can choose $x_1 = x_2 = 1$ and $x_3 = x_4 = \dots = x_n = -\frac{2}{n-2}$.
- Then, $x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n = 0$ and $x_1 x_2 + x_2 x_3 + \dots + x_{n - 1} x_n + x_n x_1 = 1 - \frac{4}{n-2} > 0$.
- Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{2}$.


Question: Mikka wants to order a pizza with two different toppings. He has 8 different toppings to choose from. How many different pizzas could he order?
Knowledge Retrieval:
- The question involves the concept of combinations in mathematics, specifically choosing 2 items from a set of 8.
- The order of the toppings does not matter in this case, so it's a combination, not a permutation.
- The formula for combinations is C(n, r) = n! / [(n-r)! * r!], where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and "!" denotes factorial.
- In this case, n = 8 (the number of different toppings) and r = 2 (the number of toppings Mikka wants on his pizza).
Solution:
- Using the formula for combinations, we have C(8, 2) = 8! / [(8-2)! * 2!]
- Simplifying, we get C(8, 2) = 8*7 / 2*1 = 28
- Therefore, the answer is  $\\boxed{28}$.

Question: A regular tetrahedron is a pyramid with four faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle.\n\nLet $V$ be the volume of a regular tetrahedron whose sides each have length $1$. What is the exact value of $V^2$ ?
Knowledge Retrieval: 
- A regular tetrahedron is a type of pyramid with four faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. This means all sides and angles are equal.
- The formula for the volume of a regular tetrahedron with side length a is V = a³/ (6√2).
- In this case, the side length a is given as 1. 
- The question asks for the square of the volume, so we need to square the result of the volume calculation.
Solution:
- The volume of the regular tetrahedron with side length 1 is V = 1³ / (6√2) = 1 / (6√2).
- Squaring this volume, we get V² = (1 / (6√2))² = 1 / 72.
- Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{72}}$.
