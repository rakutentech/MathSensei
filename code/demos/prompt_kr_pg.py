Question: A piece of yarn is $60$ cm long. The yarn is cut so that one piece is five times the length of the other piece. How many centimeters long is the shorter piece?
Knowledge:
- The question involves a simple ratio problem, where the total length of the yarn is divided into two parts in a ratio of 5:1.
- The total length of the yarn is given as 60 cm.
- To find the length of the shorter piece, we need to divide the total length by the sum of the parts of the ratio (5 + 1 = 6) and then multiply by the part of the ratio that represents the shorter piece (1).

Question: Evaluate: $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3} \\right)$
Knowledge:
- The expression given is a product of two fractions: (1/2 + 1/3) and (1/2 - 1/3).
- To evaluate the expression, we first need to find the sum and difference of the fractions inside the parentheses.
- To add or subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 6.
- Once we have the common denominator, we can add or subtract the numerators and then simplify the fractions if necessary.
- Finally, we multiply the resulting fractions to find the value of the expression.

Question: Let $S$ be the set of complex numbers of the form $a + bi,$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers.  We say that $z \\in S$ is a unit if there exists a $w \\in S$ such that $zw = 1.$  Find the number of units in $S.$
Knowledge:
- A complex number is of the form z = a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit (iÂ² = -1).
- In this case, a and b are integers.
- The question asks for the number of units in the set S, which means we need to find the number of complex numbers z in S such that there exists another complex number w in S with the property that zw = 1.
- The product of two complex numbers (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i, where a, b, c, and d are real numbers.
- In this case, a, b, c, and d are integers.
- To find the units, we need to find the pairs of complex numbers z and w in S such that their product is equal to 1, i.e., (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i = 1 + 0i.

Question: If $F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c ^ d$, what is the value of $b$ such that $F(4, b, 2, 3) = 12$?
Knowledge:
Knowledge:
- The function F(a, b, c, d) is defined as F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c^d.
- The question asks for the value of b such that F(4, b, 2, 3) = 12.
- To find the value of b, we need to substitute the given values of a, c, and d into the function and solve for b.
Python code:
# Python Code, print answer.Also Output all the relevant objects in the intermediate steps of the python code. Make sure that the first line of the code is always 'from sympy import *'
from sympy import *
# Define the variables
a, b, c, d = symbols('a b c d')
# Define the function
F = a**b + c**d
# Substitute the given values into the function
F_sub = F.subs({a:4, c:2, d:3})
# Solve the equation F_sub = 12 for b
solution = solve(F_sub - 12, b)
print("Solution:",solution)
# Print the solution
print('b =', solution[0])

Question: How many ways are there to put 4 balls in 3 boxes if two balls are indistinguishably green, two are indistinguishably red, and the boxes are distinguishable?
Knowledge:
- The question involves the concept of combinatorics, specifically counting the number of ways to distribute objects into groups.
- There are 4 balls in total, with 2 green balls and 2 red balls that are indistinguishable.
- There are 3 distinguishable boxes to place the balls in.
- We can consider the distribution of green balls and red balls separately, and then multiply the results to get the total number of ways.
Python code:
# Python Code, print answer.Also Output all the relevant objects in the intermediate steps of the python code. Make sure that the first line of the code is always 'from sympy import *'
from sympy import *
# Define the number of balls and boxes
num_balls_green = 2
num_balls_red = 2
num_boxes = 3
# Define the function to calculate the number of ways to distribute balls into boxes
def calc_ways(num_balls, num_boxes):
    return binomial(num_balls + num_boxes - 1, num_balls)
# Calculate the number of ways to distribute the green balls and the red balls
ways_green = calc_ways(num_balls_green, num_boxes)
print("Number of ways green:",ways_green)
ways_red = calc_ways(num_balls_red, num_boxes)
print("Number of ways red:",ways_red)
# The total number of ways is the product of the number of ways to distribute the green balls and the red balls
ans = ways_green * ways_red

Question: Rectangle $ABCD$ is the base of pyramid $PABCD$. If $AB = 3$, $BC = 2$, $\\overline{PA}\\perp \\overline{AD}$, $\\overline{PA}\\perp \\overline{AB}$, and $PC = 5$, then what is the volume of $PABCD$?
Knowledge:
- The question involves finding the volume of a pyramid with a rectangular base.
- The formula for the volume of a pyramid is V = (1/3) * B * h, where B is the area of the base and h is the height.
- The height of the pyramid is the length of PA, which is perpendicular to both AD and AB.
- Since PA is perpendicular to both AD and AB, triangle PAB is a right triangle with PA as the height, AB as the base, and PB as the hypotenuse.
- Similarly, triangle PBC is a right triangle with PA as the height, BC as the base, and PC as the hypotenuse.
Python code:
# Python Code, print answer.Also Output all the relevant objects in the intermediate steps of the python code. Make sure that the first line of the code is always 'from sympy import *'
from sympy import *
# Given values
AB = 3
BC = 2
PC = 5
# Since PA is perpendicular to both AB and AD, triangle PAB is a right triangle.
# We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find PA.
PA = sqrt(PC**2 - AB**2 - BC**2)
print("PA value:",PA)
# The volume of a pyramid is 1/3 * base area * height
base_area = AB * BC
print("Base Area",base_area)
volume = Rational(1, 3) * base_area * PA
print("Volume",volume)


Question: The expression $\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}$ can be simplified to $a\\sqrt b$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers and $b$ is not divisible by any perfect square greater than 1. What is $a+b$?
Knowledge:
- The given expression is $\sqrt{(\sqrt{56})(\sqrt{126})}$.
- To simplify the expression, we can first multiply the square roots inside the main square root.
- The product of the square roots is $\sqrt{56} \cdot \sqrt{126}$.
- We can multiply the numbers inside the square roots: $56 \cdot 126$.
- Next, we can find the prime factorization of the product and simplify the square root.
- Finally, we need to find the sum of the simplified coefficients a and b.

Python code:
# Python Code, print answer. Also Output all the relevant objects in the intermediate steps of the python code.Make sure that the first line of the code is always 'from sympy import *'
from sympy import *
# Define the expression
expr = sqrt(sqrt(56)*sqrt(126))
# Simplify the expression
simplified_expr = simplify(expr)
print("Simplified equation:", simplified_expr)
# Compare simplified equation with a*sqrt(b)
# Print a+b
