Question: If $z^2 + z + 1 = 0,$ find\n\\[z^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53}.\\]
Type: Intermediate Algebra
Level: Level 4
We can simplify the above expression z^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53} by using z^2 + z + 1 = 0 taking z^{49} common.
text_generator('Simplify z^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53} using the facts z^2 + z + 1 = 0', context)
We know that z^2 + z + 1 = 0, so z^2 = -z - 1 and z^3 = -z^2 - z = z + 1 - z = 1. Using this, we can simplify the expression as follows:\n\nz^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53} \n= z^{49}(1 + z+ z^2 + z^3 + z^4) \n= z^{49}(z^3 + z^4) \n= z^{52}(1+z) \n=z^{52}(-z^2)\n=-z^{54} \n\nTherefore, z^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53} simplifies to -z^{54}.
We know the expression is -z^{54}, so we need to find the solutions z to the equation z^2 + z + 1 = 0 using python code.
Task: Solve z^2 + z + 1 = 0 using Python code.
Python code:
from sympy import *
# Define the variable z
z = sympy.Symbol('z')
# Define the equation
eq = z**2 + z + 1
# Solve the equation
sol = sympy.solve(eq, z)
# Print the solution
print(sol)

Question: Find all values of $k$ for which the system\n\\begin{align*}\nx + ky - z &= 0, \\\\\nkx - y - z &= 0, \\\\\nx + y - kz &= 0\n\\end{align*}has a non-trivial solution.  (In other words, find all values of $k$ for which the system has a solution other than $(x,y,z) = (0,0,0).$)
Type: Precalculus
Level: Level 5
We need to find when a system of equations have a non-trivial solution.
Knowledge_retrieval('Retrieve knowledge/background information on when does a system of equations have a non-trivial solution')
A system of equations has a non-trivial solution if and only if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is equal to zero. This is known as the determinant test. \n\nIn other words, if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is not equal to zero, then the system has a unique solution (known as the trivial solution). However, if the determinant is equal to zero, then the system has either no solution or infinitely many solutions (known as non-trivial solutions). \n\nThe determinant test can be applied to systems of linear equations in any number of variables. It is a powerful tool for determining the existence and uniqueness of solutions to systems of equations.
We have to solve for k by making the determinant of the coefficient matrix equal to zero. 
Task: Solve for k by making the determinant of the coefficient matrix equal to zero using python code.
Python code:
from sympy import *
k=symbols('k')
A = Matrix([[1, k, -1], [k, -1, -1], [1, 1, -k]])
det_A = A.det()
solutions = solve(det_A, k)
print("The values of k for which the system has a non-trivial solution are:")

    print(solution)

Question : Determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word MISSISSIPPI.
Type: Counting & Probability
Level: Level 3
To determine the number of ways to arrange the word, we need to consider the repetition of letters.
Task: Find the number of ways to arrange the word MISSISSIPPI considering the repetition of letters using python code
Python code:
from sympy import *
word = "MISSISSIPPI"
# count the frequency of each letter
letter_counts = {}
for letter in word:
            if letter in letter_counts:
                letter_counts[letter] += 1
            else:        
                letter_counts[letter] = 1
# calculate the number of arrangements
num_arrangements = factorial(len(word))
for count in letter_counts.values():
        num_arrangements //= factorial(count)
print(num_arrangements)
