Context: 
Question: If $z^2 + z + 1 = 0,$ find\n\\[z^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53}.\\]
Type: Intermediate Algebra
Level: Level 4
We can simplify the above expression z^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53} by using z^2 + z + 1 = 0 taking z^{49} common.
Task: Simplify z^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53} by taking z^{49} common, using the facts z^2 + z + 1 = 0
Output: We know that z^2 + z + 1 = 0, so z^2 = -z - 1 and z^3 = -z^2 - z = z + 1 - z = 1. Using this, we can simplify the expression as follows:\n\nz^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53} \n= z^{49}(1 + z+ z^2 + z^3 + z^4) \n= z^{49}(z^3 + z^4) \n= z^{52}(1+z) \n=z^{52}(-z^2)\n=-z^{54} \n\nTherefore, z^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53} simplifies to -z^{54}.

Question: What is $\\frac{9}{2}$ expressed as a decimal?
Type: Prealgebra
Level: Level 2
We can convert $\\frac{9}{2}$ into decimal directly.
Task: Convert $\\frac{9}{2}$ into decimal
Output: To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator. \n\n$$\\frac{9}{2} = 4.5$$\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{9}{2}$ as a decimal is $4.5$.
