Question: If $z^2 + z + 1 = 0,$ find\n\\[z^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53}.\\]
Type: Intermediate Algebra
Level: Level 4
We can simplify the above expression z^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53} by using z^2 + z + 1 = 0 taking z^{49} common.
text_generator('Simplify z^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53} using the facts z^2 + z + 1 = 0', context)
We know that z^2 + z + 1 = 0, so z^2 = -z - 1 and z^3 = -z^2 - z = z + 1 - z = 1. Using this, we can simplify the expression as follows:\n\nz^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53} \n= z^{49}(1 + z+ z^2 + z^3 + z^4) \n= z^{49}(z^3 + z^4) \n= z^{52}(1+z) \n=z^{52}(-z^2)\n=-z^{54} \n\nTherefore, z^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53} simplifies to -z^{54}.
We know the expression is -z^{54}, so we need to find the solutions z to the equation z^2 + z + 1 = 0 using Wolfram API.
Task: Solve z^2 + z + 1 = 0 using Wolfram Alpha API.
Thought: To find the answer to the problem, we need to solve the equation using Wolfram code. Do you know the Wolfram Alpha command to do this? 
Answer: Yes, the Wolfram Alpha command to solve the given quadratic expression is:
