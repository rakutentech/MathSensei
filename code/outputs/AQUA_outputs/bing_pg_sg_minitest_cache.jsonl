We can use the fact that the change in angle of elevation is from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 over a period of 10 minutes to find the height of the tower. Then, we can use the distance traveled by the car and the height of the tower to find the time taken by the car to reach the base of the tower.\nSolution:\n- Let the height of the tower be h and the distance traveled by the car be d.\n- From trigonometry, we have h/d = tan(60\u00b0) - tan(45\u00b0) = (\u221a3 - 1).\n- Let the speed of the car be s. Then, we have d = s * (10/60) = s/6.\n- Substituting d in terms of s in the previous equation, we get h = (\u221a3 - 1) * (s/6).\n- Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to get the distance between the car and the tower when the angle of elevation is 60\u00b0, which is given by sqrt(h^2 + d^2) = sqrt((\u221a3 - 1)^2 * (s^2/36) + s^2/36) = s/6 * sqrt(4 - 2\u221a3).\n- To find the time taken by the car to reach the base of the tower, we can use the formula time = distance/speed. The distance to be covered is d = s/6 * (sqrt(4 - 2\u221a3) + 1) and the speed is s.

We can also use the fact that the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells.\nThe profit formula is used to calculate the amount of gain that has been made in a transaction. When the selling price of a product is greater than its cost price, a profit is earned. Profit is calculated as: Profit=Selling Price-Cost Price.

Since there are 10 types of books, we need at least 10 unique codes. We can use single letters for 26 codes and pairs of two different letters for 26 x 25 = 650 codes (since order does not matter). Therefore, the smallest number of letters required is 2, giving us a total of 26 + 650 = 676 possible codes.\nThis question involves finding the minimum number of letters needed to represent 10 different types of books.

Answer: A)242.\nWe can use the formula: Product of two numbers = LCM * GCD. We know that one of the numbers is 350 and the GCD is 11. Therefore, the other number can be found by dividing the product of the two numbers by 350 and then dividing by 11. This gives us: (350 * other number)/(11*350) = 7700/11.

We can start by looking at the last row, which gives us the product of A, M, I, and D. Since A and M appear in both the first and second rows, we know that their product must be either M or A. Similarly, since D appears in the first row and E appears in the second row, we know that their product must be either D or E. Therefore, we can fill in the following possibilities:\n\nM A D\nB E\n-------------\nM A D\nR A E\n-------------\nA M I D\n\nM A D\nB E\n-------------\nM A D\nR A E\n-------------\nA M I D\nM A D\nB E\n-------------\nM A D\nR A E\n-------------\nA M I D\n\nNow we can look at the first two rows to determine the values of the remaining letters. Since M*A = D, we know that M and A must be factors of D. The only possibilities for D are 0 and 1, since we are dealing with a multiplication table. If D = 0, then M and A must both be 0, which is not possible since we are given that all the letters are distinct. Therefore, we must have D = 1, and since M and A are factors of 1, they must be either 1 or -1. However, we know that all the letters are positive, so we must have M = A = 1. Now we can fill in the rest of the table:\n\n1 1 1\nB E\n-------------\n1 1 1\nR 1 E\n-------------\n1 M I 1\nM A D\nB E\n-------------\nM A D\nR A E\n-------------\nA M I D\n\nSince B*E = D, we know that B and E must be factors of D = 1. Therefore, we must have B = E = 1. Finally, we can fill in the last row of the table:\n\n1 1 1\n1 1\n-------------\n1 1 1\nR 1 1\n-------------\n1 1 I 1\nM A D\n1 1\n-------------\n1 1 1\nR 1 1\n-------------\n1 1 0 1\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 9 2 0 1.", "bing_query2": " How to decipher a multiplication table with missing values?", "bing_query2_output": ["Lesson: Multiplication Tables Mathematics \u2022 3rd Grade.

He needs to borrow $20 000 = $800 = $19 200. He would borrow this money on day 30 and repay it on day 100 (the day the original invoice is due) resulting in a 70-day loan. The interest he should be willing to pay on borrowed money should not exceed the cash discount $800.\nr=I/pt=21.73%\nThe highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 21.73%. This is a break-even rate. If he can borrow money, say at a rate of 15%, he should do so. He would borrow $19 200 for 70 days at 15%.

The difference between CI and SI is given by CI-SI = P*((1+R/100)^T - 1) - (P*R*T)/100.\nThe formula for simple interest is: SI = PRT/100, where P is the principal, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time. The formula for compound interest is: A = P(1 + R/100)^t, where A is the amount after t years, P is the principal, R is the rate of interest, and t is the time. The difference between compound interest and simple interest for a given principal, rate, and time can be calculated using the formula: CI - SI = P[(1 + R/100)^t - 1] - PTR/100.\n\nSolution: ", "solution_generator:output": "- Let the rate of interest be R.\n- From the given information, we have (5000*R*2)/100 - 5000*(1+R/100)^2 + 5000 = 72\n- Simplifying this equation, we get R = 6%.\n- Therefore, the answer is C."}
