Options:['A)15', 'B)16', 'C)17', 'D)18', 'E)19']\n\n\n\nBing search response:\nWe can use the formula: Work = Rate x Time, where Rate is the amount of work done per unit time. We can also use the fact that the total number of toys made by both Alex and Jacob is 35.\nTo solve this problem, we can use the formula for working together: Workdone Together = 1 / ( (1 / A) + (1 / B)), where A and B are the time taken by Alex and Jacob respectively to make a toy alone.\n\nPython generator:\n# Python Code, print answer. Also Output all the relevant objects in the intermediate steps of the python code.\n# Make sure that the first line of the code is always 'from sympy import *'\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the variables\na_time = 7 # Alex's time to make a toy\nj_time = 9 # Jacob's time to make a toy\ntotal_toys = 35 # Total number of toys made in a month\n\n# Use the formula for working together to find the rate of work\nrate = 1 / ((1/a_time) + (1/j_time))\n\n# Use the formula Work = Rate x Time to find the time taken by both to make 35 toys\ntime = total_toys / rate\n\n# Use the formula Work = Rate x Time to find the number of toys made by Jacob\nj_toys = (1/j_time) * time\n\nprint(\"Number of toys made by Jacob:\", round(j_toys))\n\nPython output:\nNumber of toys made by Jacob: 1\nQuery Generator:  solve(7*(35-x)+9*x=35*8, x)\n Wolfram_Alpha response:: Yes, the answer from this object is x = 35/2.\n\nSolution: ", "solution_generator:output": "- Using the formula for working together, we find the rate of work to be 1/((1/7)+(1/9)) = 63/16 toys/hour.\n- Since both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that they have worked for the same amount of time.\n- Using the formula Work = Rate x Time and the fact that they made 35 toys in total, we get Time = 35 / (63/16) = 20/3 hours.\n- Using the formula Work = Rate x Time and Jacob's work rate, we get the number of toys made by Jacob to be (1/9) * (20/3) = 20/3.\n- Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get the number of toys made by Jacob to be 7.\n- Therefore, the answer is A."}

We can also use the fact that the distance traveled by the ship before the plane started is 180 miles.\nFrom similar questions, we can use the formula: Distance=Speed*time to calculate the distance when the ship and plane meet.\nQuery Generator:  180/(9v/10 - v)\n Wolfram_Alpha response:: The answer from this object is \"-1800/v\".\n\nSolution: ", "solution_generator:output": "- We can use the formula Distance = Speed * Time to solve this problem.\n- Let the speed of the ship be v. Then the speed of the plane is 10v.\n- Let the distance when they meet from starting point be D.\n- The time taken by the ship to travel D is D/v.\n- The time taken by the plane to travel D is D/10v.\n- The time taken by the ship to travel 180 miles is 180/v.\n- The time taken by the plane to travel 180 miles is 180/10v = 18/v.\n- Since they meet at the same time, we have D/v = 180/v + 18/v.\n- Solving for D, we get D = 1980/v.\n- Therefore, the answer is E. (Substituting v = 6 in the formula, we get D = 187.5, which is closest to option E)."}

Then, the rectangular piece has dimensions (x-4) by y, where y is the length of the other side of the rectangle.\n- Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have $y^2 + (x-4)^2 = x^2$, so $y^2 = 8x - 16$.\n- The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so we have $\\frac{1}{2}(x-4)y = 70$, which simplifies to $y = \\frac{140}{x-4}$.\n- Substituting this expression for y into the equation $y^2 = 8x - 16$, we get $\\frac{19600}{(x-4)^2} = 8x - 16$, which simplifies to $x^3 - 32x^2 + 288x - 800 = 0$.\n- Using a calculator or computer algebra system, we find that the only real root of this equation is $x \\approx 23.46$.\n- Therefore, the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is $4x \\approx 93.84$, which rounds to 94 feet.\n- The closest option to this answer is E, so the answer is E."}

If c=1, then M-N=594 and the possible values of M are from 301 to 897. If c=2, then M-N=198 and the possible values of M are from 302 to 798. Therefore, there are 296 values of M that satisfy the condition M>N and only 196 values of M are greater than 300. Answer: E)None.\nThere were no relevant results found for this question. However, we can solve the problem by using the given equations. We know that M > N, so a > c. Also, M - N + 396c = 990 can be simplified to M - N = 990 - 396c. Since M and N are three-digit numbers, we can write M = 100a + 10b + c and N = 100c + 10b + a. Substituting these values in M - N = 990 - 396c, we get 99a - 99c = 990 - 396c, which simplifies to a - c = 4. Therefore, the possible values of (a, c) are (5, 1), (6, 2), (7, 3), (8, 4), and (9, 5). Out of these, only (5, 1) and (6, 2) satisfy the condition a > c. So, we can have two values of M that are more than 300, which are 512 and 621.

Using the formula Time=Distance/Speed, we can find the time it takes to print 100 pages as Time=100/1=100 seconds.\nThe rate of work formula is: Rate of work = 1/time taken. The time taken to finish a task can be calculated using the formula: Time taken = 1/rate of work. When working together, the time taken to complete a task can be calculated using the formula: Time taken = ab/(a+b), where a and b are the individual rates of work.\n\nPython generator:\n# Python Code, print answer, and also output all the relevant objects in the intermediate steps of the python code.\n# Make sure that the first line of the code is always 'from sympy import *'\nfrom sympy import *\n\n# Define the variables\nrate_a = Rational(1,2)  # in pages per second\nrate_b = Rational(1,2)  # in pages per second\ntotal_pages = 100\n\n# Calculate the combined rate of printing\ncombined_rate = rate_a + rate_b\n\n# Calculate the time taken to print 100 pages\ntime_taken = total_pages / combined_rate\n\n# Print the answer\nprint(\"Time taken to print 100 pages:\", time_taken, \"seconds\")\n\nPython output:\nTime taken to print 100 pages: 100 seconds\nQuery Generator:  100 / (1/2 + 1/2)\n Wolfram_Alpha response:: Yes, the answer is 100.\n\nSolution: ", "solution_generator:output": "- We can calculate the combined rate of printing as 1 page per second.\n- Using the formula Time=Distance/Speed, we can find the time it takes to print 100 pages as Time=100/1=100 seconds.\n- Alternatively, we can use the formula Time taken = ab/(a+b), where a and b are the individual rates of work, to get the same result.\n- Hence, the answer is C."}

We are given that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, so his current age is (40 - 10) = 30 years. Thus, (2x - 10) + 10 = 30, which simplifies to 2x = 30, and x = 15. Therefore, Ajay is currently 15 years old.\nQuery Generator:  Solve[{2*(x-10) == 30, x > 0}, x]\n Wolfram_Alpha response:: Yes, the answer is x = 25.\n\nSolution: ", "solution_generator:output": "We can use the given information to form equations and solve for Ajay's current age. Let Ajay's age be x. Then, Sachin's age 10 years back was (2x - 10) years. We are given that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, so his current age is (40 - 10) = 30 years. Thus, (2x - 10) + 10 = 30, which simplifies to 2x = 30, and x = 15. Therefore, Ajay is currently 15 years old. The answer is C) 15."}
