Question: When the expression $-2x^2-20x-53$ is written in the form $a(x+d)^2+e$, where $a$, $d$, and $e$ are constants, what is the sum $a+d+e$?
Modules used till now: []
Mathematics Problem Type: Algebra
Level of Problem: Level 5 
Final Query: complete the square -2x^2-20x-53
Wolfram_Alpha response: -3 - 2 (5 + x)^2
Solution:
- From WolframAlpha response, we find -2x^2-20x-53 = -3 - 2 (5 + x)^2.
- Thus we have a =-2, d = 5, e=-3. 
- So, a+d+e = 0
- Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{0}$.


Question: Suppose that the minimum value of $f(x) = \\cos 2x - 2a (1 + \\cos x)$ is $-\\frac{1}{2}.$  Find $a.$
Modules used till now: []
Mathematics Problem Type: Precalculus
Level of Problem: Level 5 
Bing search response: To find the minimum value of a function we need to find the derivative.
Final Query: diff(cos(2x) - 2a(1 + cos(x)), x)
Wolfram_Alpha response: The answer from Wolfram alpha is - 2 sin(2 x).
Solution:
- We find the derivative of f is - 2 sin(2 x).
- The minimum value occurs when - 2 sin(2 x) = 0
- Hence, f is minimum when x = pi/2.
- Substituting in f(x) we get, f(x) = -1 - 2a 
- Thus, -1 -2a = -1/2
- Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{\\frac{-1}{4}}$.

Question: Sam and Jeff had a skipping competition at recess. The competition was split into four rounds. Sam completed 1 more skip than Jeff in the first round. Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam in the second round. Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam in the third round. Jeff got tired and only completed half the number of skips as Sam in the last round. If Sam skipped 16 times in each round, what is the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff?
Modules used till now: []
Solution:
- In round one, Jeff completed 16 - 1 = 15. 
- In round two, Jeff completed 16 - 3 = 13. 
- In round three, Jeff completed 16 + 4 = 20. 
- In round four, Jeff completed 16 / 2 = 8. 
- Jeff completed 15 + 13 + 20 + 8 = 56 skips in total. 
- Jeff skipped an average of 56 / 4 = 14 skips per round.

Question: Tim has some cans of soda. Jeff comes by, and takes 6 cans of soda from Tim. Tim then goes and buys another half the amount of soda cans he had left. If Tim has 24 cans of soda in the end, how many cans of soda did Tim have at first?
Modules used till now: []
Solution:
- Let x be the number of cans Tim has at first. 
- After Jeff comes by, Tim has x-6 cans left. 
- Tim buys another (x-6)/2 cans. 
- x-6+(x-6)/2=24 2*x-12+x-6=48 3*x-18=48 3*x=66 x=22

Question: When the expression $-2x^2-20x-53$ is written in the form $a(x+d)^2+e$, where $a$, $d$, and $e$ are constants, what is the sum $a+d+e$? 
Modules used till now: ['wolfram_alpha_search']
Final Query: complete the square -2x^2-20x-53
Wolfram_Alpha response: -3 - 2 (5 + x)^2
Solution:
- From WolframAlpha response, we find -2x^2-20x-53 = -3 - 2 (5 + x)^2.
