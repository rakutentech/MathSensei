Read the erroneous python code denoted by 'Incorrect Python code' and the error message denoted by 'Error message' , and output the new corrected code free from errors and the list of changes you made. Given below are some examples.
Incorrect Python code:
# Find the x-coordinate of the point where the line x = -2 intersects with the other two lines
x_int = -2
y_int1 = -2*x_int + 8
y_int2 = Rational(1, 2)*x_int - 2
# Find the height of the triangle formed by the two lines and x = -2
height = abs(y_int1 - y_int2)
# Find the length of the base of the triangle
base = abs(4 - x_int)
# Find the area of the triangle using A = 1/2 * base * height
area = Rational(1, 2) * base * height
print("Area of triangle:", area)
Error message:
Rational not defined
Corrected Python Code:
from sympy import *
# Find the x-coordinate of the point where the line x = -2 intersects with the other two lines
x_int = -2
y_int1 = -2*x_int + 8
y_int2 = Rational(1, 2)*x_int - 2
# Find the height of the triangle formed by the two lines and x = -2
height = abs(y_int1 - y_int2)
# Find the length of the base of the triangle
base = abs(4 - x_int)
# Find the area of the triangle using A = 1/2 * base * height
area = Rational(1, 2) * base * height
print("Area of triangle:", area)
Errors fixed:
Imported the sympy library to resolve the "Rational not defined" error.



Incorrect Python code:
from sympy import *
# Define the variables
x = symbols('x')
# Define the equation
eq = Eq(45*x**2 + 118*x + 56, (a*x + b)*(c*x + d))
# Expand the right side of the equation
expanded_eq = expand(eq.rhs)
# Solve for the coefficients a, b, c, and d
coefficients = solve([coeff(eq.lhs, x, i) - coeff(expanded_eq, x, i) for i in range(4)], [a, b, c, d])
# Print the factored form of the equation
print("Factored form:", (coefficients[a]*x + coefficients[b])*(coefficients[c]*x + coefficients[d]))
Error message: name 'a' is not defined
Corrected Python Code:
from sympy import *
# Define the variables
x ,a,b,c,d= symbols('x a b c d')
# Define the equation
eq = Eq(45*x**2 + 118*x + 56, (a*x + b)*(c*x + d))
# Expand the right side of the equation
expanded_eq = expand(eq.rhs)
# Solve for the coefficients a, b, c, and d
coefficients = solve([eq.lhs.coeff(x, i) - expanded_eq.coeff(x, i) for i in range(4)], [a, b, c, d])
print(coefficients)
Errors fixed:
Symbols a,b,c,d are declared.
Fixed the incorrect way of using coeff function in Sympy.
Removed incorrect line using symbols as indices.




Incorrect Python code:
from sympy import *
# Define the variables
x = symbols('x')
# Convert x from degrees to radians
x_rad = x * pi / 180
# Set up the equation sin(x) = sin(x_rad)
eq = Eq(sin(x), sin(x_rad))
# Solve the equation for the two least positive real values of x
sol = solve(eq, x)
# Extract the values of m, n, p, and q from the solutions
frac1 = sol[0] / pi
frac2 = sol[1] / pi
m = int(frac1.numerator)
n = int(frac1.denominator) + int(pi)
p = int(frac2.numerator)
q = int(frac2.denominator) - int(pi)
# Calculate the sum of m, n, p, and q
sum = m + n + p + q
print("Sum:", sum)
Error message: 'Mul' object has no attribute 'numerator'
Corrected Python Code:
from sympy import *
# Define the variables
x = symbols('x')
# Convert x from degrees to radians
x_rad = x * pi / 180
# Set up the equation sin(x) = sin(x_rad)
eq = Eq(sin(x), sin(x_rad))
# Solve the equation for the two least positive real values of x
sol = solve(eq, x)
# Extract the values of m, n, p, and q from the solutions
frac1 = sol[0] / pi
frac2 = sol[1] / pi
m,n = fraction(frac1)
p,q= fraction(frac2)
# Calculate the sum of m, n, p, and q
sum = m + n + p + q
print("Sum:", sum)
Errors fixed:
Fixed the incorrect way of extracting numerator and denominator from 'Mul' object.
