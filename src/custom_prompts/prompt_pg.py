Read the following mathematical question and then write Python code using the Sympy library to answer the question or generate an intermediate result.


Question: A piece of yarn is $60$ cm long. The yarn is cut so that one piece is five times the length of the other piece. How many centimeters long is the shorter piece?
Modules used till now: [Knowledge Retrieval]
Mathematics Problem Type: PreAlgebra
Level of Problem: Level 2 
Knowledge Retrieval:
- The question involves a simple ratio problem, where the total length of the yarn is divided into two parts in a ratio of 5:1.
- The total length of the yarn is given as 60 cm.
- To find the length of the shorter piece, we need to divide the total length by the sum of the parts of the ratio (5 + 1 = 6) and then multiply by the part of the ratio that represents the shorter piece (1).

Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam in the second round. Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam in the third round. Jeff got tired and only completed half the number of skips as Sam in the last round. If Sam skipped 16 times in each round, what is the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff?

Question: A piece of yarn is $60$ cm long. The yarn is cut so that one piece is five times the length of the other piece. How many centimeters long is the shorter piece? Options:['A)10', 'B)34', 'C)0', 'D)4', 'E)35']
Modules used till now: [Knowledge Retrieval]
Knowledge Retrieval:
- The question involves a simple ratio problem, where the total length of the yarn is divided into two parts in a ratio of 5:1.
- The total length of the yarn is given as 60 cm.
- To find the length of the shorter piece, we need to divide the total length by the sum of the parts of the ratio (5 + 1 = 6) and then multiply by the part of the ratio that represents the shorter piece (1).

Question: How many ways are there to put 4 balls in 3 boxes if two balls are indistinguishably green, two are indistinguishably red, and the boxes are distinguishable? Options:['A)15', 'B)13', 'C)36', 'D)11', 'E)20']
Modules used till now: [Knowledge Retrieval]

- The question involves the concept of combinatorics, specifically counting the number of ways to distribute objects into groups.
- There are 4 balls in total, with 2 green balls and 2 red balls that are indistinguishable.
- There are 3 distinguishable boxes to place the balls in.
- We can consider the distribution of green balls and red balls separately, and then multiply the results to get the total number of ways.
