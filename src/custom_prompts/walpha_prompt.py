Answer: 336
Assumption: (4!)/((4 - 3)!) 
Answer: 24


Question: A regular tetrahedron is a pyramid with four faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle.\n\nLet $V$ be the volume of a regular tetrahedron whose sides each have length $1$. What is the exact value of $V^2$ ?
Wolfram alpha LLM output: 
Assumption: 1^3/(6 sqrt(2)) 
Answer: sqrt(2)/12
Assumption: (1^3/(6 sqrt(2)))^2 
Answer: 1/72


Question: The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of $y=\\frac{1}{2}x^2-9$ can be expressed as $a$.  Find $a^2$.
Wolfram alpha LLM output: 
Assumption: d/dx(x^2 + (x^2/2 - 9)^2) = x (x^2 - 16) 
Answer: d/dx(x^2 + (x^2/2 - 9)^2) = x (x^2 - 16)
Assumption: x^3 - 16 x = 0 
Answer: x = -4
