So, the work done by A and B together is 3(a+b) = 1-2a.\n- Solving these two equations, we get a = 1/8 and b = 5/24.\n- Now, we can find the time taken by B to fill the pool alone using the formula: Work = Rate x Time\n- So, 1 = b x t, where t is the time taken by B to fill the pool alone.\n- Solving this equation, we get t = 40/3.\n- Therefore, the answer is A."}

Then, the cost of 7200 pens is 7200x.\n- The profit is the revenue minus the cost, so we have 18000 = 72000 - 0.1 * 7200x - 7200x.\n- Solving for x, we get x = 6.\n- Therefore, the answer is A."}
