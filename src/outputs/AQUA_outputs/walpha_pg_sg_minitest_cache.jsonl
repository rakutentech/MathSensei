Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/\u221a3\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h \u2013 x = h - h/\u221a3.\n10 minutes = h *( 1 \u2013 1\u221a3)\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 \u2013 1\u221a3).\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/\u221a3, it takes :\nh = 10 / (1 \u2013 1/\u221a3)\nh / \u221a3 = 10/ \u221a3 * (1 \u2013 1/\u221a3).

If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.\nThe two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence\nT = 13 X = 7 Y\nHence 13 X = 7 Y\nSolve the above for X\nX = 7 Y / 13\nWe want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13.

Therefore, the total number of pens manufactured by the company is (7200/0.9) = 8000.

Then, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5y.\n- We have y + 2.5y = infected_files, where infected_files is the total number of infected files, which is 250.\n- Solving for y, we get y = 62.5.\n- Therefore, the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is 62.5.\n- Substituting this value in the formula 125 - 2.5x, we get 125 - 2.5 * 62.5 = 125 - 156.25 = -31.25.\n- Since the number of files cannot be negative, the answer is 0.\n- Therefore, the answer is C."}
