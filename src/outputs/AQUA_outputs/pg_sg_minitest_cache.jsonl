Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/\u221a3\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h \u2013 x = h - h/\u221a3.\n10 minutes = h *( 1 \u2013 1\u221a3)\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 \u2013 1\u221a3).\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/\u221a3, it takes :\nh = 10 / (1 \u2013 1/\u221a3)\nh / \u221a3 = 10/ \u221a3 * (1 \u2013 1/\u221a3).

Then the number can be written as $100a + 10b + c$. We know that:\n\n- $a + b + c = 17$\n- $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109$\n- $100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a$\n\nSimplifying the third equation, we get:\n\n$99a - 99c = 495$\n\n$a - c = 5$\n\nNow we can substitute $c = a - 5$ into the first two equations:\n\n- $2a + b = 17$\n- $2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2(a-5)^2 = 109$\n\nSimplifying the second equation, we get:\n\n$a^2 + b^2 - 5a + 5 = 27$\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\n$a^2 + b^2 - 5a = 22$\n\nWe can use the first equation to solve for $b$:\n\n$b = 17 - 2a$\n\nSubstituting into the previous equation, we get:\n\n$a^2 + (17-2a)^2 - 5a = 22$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$5a^2 - 68a + 198 = 0$\n\nSolving for $a$ using the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$a = \\frac{68 \\pm \\sqrt{68^2 - 4(5)(198)}}{10}$\n\n$a = 6$ or $a = \\frac{22}{5}$\n\nSince $a$ must be an integer, we can only take $a = 6$. Then from the equation $a + b + c = 17$, we get:\n\n$b + c = 11$\n\nAnd from the equation $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109$, we get:\n\n$b^2 + c^2 = 55$\n\nWe can try the possible values of $b$ and $c$ that satisfy these two equations, and we find that $b = 4$ and $c = 7$ is the only solution. Therefore, the number is:\n\n$100a + 10b + c = 647$\n\nAnd if we subtract 495 from this number, we get:\n\n"}
