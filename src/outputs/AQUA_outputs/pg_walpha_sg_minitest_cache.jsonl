Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.\n=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.\n=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)\n=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x\n=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x\n=> y = 315 - (9/7)x\n=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,\nx = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153\nx = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144\nx = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135\nx = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126\nAs we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs.
