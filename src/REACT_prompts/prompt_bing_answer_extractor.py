Guest Feb 13, 2018 1 Answers #1 +125682 +2 If we have only one solution ...the discriminant will = 0 So a = 3 , b = 4 and c = ??? The discriminant is given by :', 'SOLUTION: x^2+4x+c=0 what value of c does the equation have one real root and what range of value does it have two roots, fo what range of values does the equation have two complex.

Useful_information: 
We get from the search that if we want a quadratic equation to have 1 root, the discriminant must be 0. 
Also we get answer to exact same question: b 2 - 4ac = 0 a=3 b=4 c = ? 4 2 - 4 (3) (c) = 0 16-12c = 0 -12c=-16 c=16/12 c=4/3

Each arithmetic sequence is uniquely defined by two coefficients: the common difference and the first term. If you know these two values, you are able to write down the whole sequence.
The formula for a_n is a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term of the sequence, a_n is the nth term of the sequence, and d is the common difference, which is obtained by subtracting the previous term from the current term.
