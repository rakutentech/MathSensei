Query: Retrieve knowledge/background information on when does a system of equations have a non-trivial solution.
Knowledge: A system of equations has a non-trivial solution if and only if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is equal to zero. This is known as the determinant test. \n\nIn other words, if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is not equal to zero, then the system has a unique solution (known as the trivial solution). However, if the determinant is equal to zero, then the system has either no solution or infinitely many solutions (known as non-trivial solutions). \n\nThe determinant test can be applied to systems of linear equations in any number of variables. It is a powerful tool for determining the existence and uniqueness of solutions to systems of equations.

Query: Retrieve knowledge/background information on the number -1/2 + sqrt(3)*i/2
Knowledge: The number -1/2 + sqrt(3)*i/2 is a complex number in the form of a+bi, where a=-1/2 and b=sqrt(3)/2. It is also known as the complex conjugate of 1/2 - sqrt(3)*i/2. \n\nThis number is a solution to the equation x^2 + x + 1 = 0, which is a quadratic equation with complex roots. The other root is the complex conjugate of -1/2 + sqrt(3)*i/2, which is 1/2 - sqrt(3)*i/2. \n\nThe number -1/2 + sqrt(3)*i/2 is also a primitive sixth root of unity, which means that it is a complex number that, when raised to the sixth power, equals 1.

Query: Retrieve knowledge/background information on what is the Vietta's formula.
Knowledge: Vieta's formula is a mathematical formula that relates the coefficients of a polynomial to the roots of the polynomial. Specifically, Vieta's formula states that for a polynomial of degree n with coefficients a0, a1, ..., an, the sum of the roots is equal to -a1/a0, and the product of the roots is equal to (-1)^n * an/a0. \n\nVieta's formula is named after the French mathematician François Viète, who first discovered it in the 16th century. The formula is widely used in algebra and calculus, particularly in the study of quadratic, cubic, and higher-degree polynomials. It provides a powerful tool for finding the roots of a polynomial without having to solve for them directly.

Query: Retrieve knowledge/background information on the PigeonHole principle.
Knowledge: The Pigeonhole principle is a fundamental principle in combinatorics that states that if there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. In other words, if n+1 or more objects are placed into n boxes, then there must be at least one box containing two or more objects.
