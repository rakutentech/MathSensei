Question : Let $a,$ $b,$ $c$ be positive real numbers such that $a + b + c = 4abc.$ Find the maximum value of\n\\[\\frac{4 \\sqrt{a} + 6 \\sqrt{b} + 12 \\sqrt{c}}{\\sqrt{abc}}.\\]

Thought 1: The first thought is always bing_search. Let us search the web for similar questions and background knowledge on how to find maximum and minimum values given constraints using calculus or other branches of math.
Action 1:  bing_search("Retrieve background knowledge and information on what math concepts can be useful for solving this problem.",context)
Observation 1: Bing search response: Optimization is the process of finding maximum and minimum values given constraints using calculus. There are different methods to solve optimization problems, including finding absolute extrema and using Lagrange multipliers.The basic idea of optimization problems is to find a particular quantity (such as profit or cost) that needs to be maximized or minimized, subject to some constraints or auxiliary conditions.

Thought 2: From the bing_search output, we got that we need to maximize n\\[\\frac{4 \\sqrt{a} + 6 \\sqrt{b} + 12 \\sqrt{c}}{\\sqrt{abc}}.\\] subject to these constraints. Let us use wolframalpha_generator for this.
Action 2: wolframalpha_generator('Maximize \\[\\frac{4 \\sqrt{a} + 6 \\sqrt{b} + 12 \\sqrt{c}}{\\sqrt{abc}}.\\] subject to a + b + c = 4abc using Wolfram Alpha code',context)
Observation 2: Wolfram Alpha Query: Maximize[{(4*Sqrt[a] + 6*Sqrt[b] + 12*Sqrt[c])/Sqrt[a*b*c], a + b + c == 4*a*b*c}, {a, b, c}], Wolfram_Alpha response:: The answer from wolfram_alpha is: max{(4 sqrt(a) + 6 sqrt(b) + 12 sqrt(c))/sqrt(a b c) |a + b + c = 4 a b c} = 28 at (a, b, c) = (0.388889, 0.875, 3.5)

Thought 3: From wolframalpha_generator output in the last step, we got that the maximum value is 28 at (a, b, c) = (0.388889, 0.875, 3.5). Hence, the answer is  $\\boxed{28}$

Observation 3: $\\boxed{28}$

Question :Find the constant $c$ such that $$(x^2-4x+3)(x+5) - (x^2+4x-5)(x-c)=0$$ for all $x.$

Thought 1: The first thought is always bing_search. Let us search the web for similar questions and background knowledge on how to find the value of a constant that converts a quadratic equation to an identity.
Action 1:  bing_search("Retrieve background knowledge and information on how to expand and simplify polynomial expressions?", ",context)
Observation 1: Bing search response: We can solve the problem by expanding the given expression and equating the coefficients of like terms to zero. This will give us the value of $c$.\nTo solve this problem, we need to expand the given expression using the distributive property and simplify by combining like terms. The FOIL method can be used to help remember the steps for multiplying two binomials.

Thought 2: From the bing_search output, we found that we need to expand and set the equation to 0. We can now try to solve the equation by using Wolfram Alpha code. Let us use wolframalpha_generator for this.
Action 2: wolframalpha_generator("solve the equation ((x^2-4x+3)*(x+5)-(x^2+4x-5)*(x-c))=0 using Wolfram Alpha code",context)
Observation 2: Wolfram Alpha Query: solve ((x^2-4x+3)*(x+5)-(x^2+4x-5)*(x-c))=0, Wolfram_Alpha response:: The answer from wolfram_alpha is that c equal to 3 for all values of x to satisfy the equation.

Thought 3: From the wolframalpha_generator output we find that the value of c is 3. Hence, The answer is \\boxed{3}. Let us end the solution using finish(thought).

Question: If $z^2 + z + 1 = 0,$ find\n\\[z^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53}.\\]

Thought 1: The first thought is always bing_search. Let us search the web for similar questions and background knowledge of properties when z^2 + z + 1 = 0. 
Action 1:  bing_search("Retrieve background knowledge and information on properties when z^2 + z + 1 = 0.",context)
Observation 1: Bing search response: We found a similar question which is If z^2+z+1=0, where z is a complex number, then what is the value of (z+1/z)^2 + (z^2+1/z^2)^2 +....+(z^6+1/z^6)^2?  Here is the answer extracted:  z^2+z+1=0 ⇒ z=ω,ω^2  ⇒(z+1/z)^2+(z^2+1/z^2)^2+......(z^6+1/z^6)^2 = (ω+ω^2)^2+(ω+ω^2)^2+(ω^3+1/ω^3)^2+(ω+ω^2)^2+(ω+ω^2)^2+(ω^6+1/ω^6)^2 ⇒ 4(ω+ω2)2+2(ω3+1ω3)2=4(1)+2(22)=4+8=12. The properties extracted when $z^2 + z + 1 = 0,$ are z = ω,ω^2 and ω^3=1.

Thought 2: From the bing_search output, we find z = ω,ω^2 and ω^3=1. We can now take z^49 common and simplify using z^2+z+1=0 and substitute ω,ω^2. Let us use text_generator for this.
Action 2: text_generator('Simplify z^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53} with the facts z^2 + z + 1 = 0 , z = ω,ω^2 , ω^3=1 using natural language text.', context)
Observation 2: text_generator output: We know that z^2 + z + 1 = 0, so z^2 = -z - 1 and z^3 = -z^2 - z = z + 1 - z = 1. Using this, we can simplify the expression as follows:\n\nz^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53} \n= z^{49}(1 + z+ z^2 + z^3 + z^4) \n= z^{49}(z^3 + z^4) \n= z^{52}(1+z) \n=z^{52}(-z^2)\n=-z^{54}. Since w^3 = 1, -z^54 = -1.

Thought 3: From the text_generator output we find that the value of -z^{54} = -1. The answer is \\boxed{-1}. Let us end the solution using finish(thought). 
Action 3: finish(thought)
Observation 3 : \\boxed{-1}

Question: Find all values of $k$ for which the system\n\\begin{align*}\nx + ky - z &= 0, \\\\\nkx - y - z &= 0, \\\\\nx + y - kz &= 0\n\\end{align*}has a non-trivial solution.  (In other words, find all values of $k$ for which the system has a solution other than $(x,y,z) = (0,0,0).$)

Thought 1: The first thought is always bing_search. Let us search the web for similar questions and background knowledge on when a system of equations has a non-trivial solution. 
Action 1:  bing_search("Retrieve background knowledge and information on when a system of equations has a non-trivial solution.",context)
Observation 1: Bing search response: A system of equations has a non-trivial solution if and only if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is equal to zero. This is known as the determinant test. \n\nIn other words, if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is not equal to zero, then the system has a unique solution (known as the trivial solution). However, if the determinant is equal to zero, then the system has either no solution or infinitely many solutions (known as non-trivial solutions). \n\nThe determinant test can be applied to systems of linear equations in any number of variables. It is a powerful tool for determining the existence and uniqueness of solutions to systems of equations.

Thought 2: From the bing_search output, we got that the determinant of the matrix should be 0. We have to solve for k by making the determinant of the coefficient matrix equal to zero. Let us use program_generator for this.
Action 2: program_generator('Solve for k by making the determinant of the coefficient matrix equal to zero using python code',context)
Observation 2 : Python code: 'from sympy import *\nk=symbols('k')\nA = Matrix([[1, k, -1], [k, -1, -1], [1, 1, -k]])\ndet_A = A.det()\nsolutions = solve(det_A, k)\nprint("The values of k for which the system has a non-trivial solution are:")\nfor solution in solutions:\nprint(solution)\n', Code Output: 'The values of k for which the system has a non-trivial solution are: -1 \n0 \n 1\n'

Thought 3: From program_generator output, we got that the values of k for which the system of equations have non-trivial solutions are (-1,0,1). Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{-1,0,1}.$
Action 3: finish(thought)
Observation 3 : $\\boxed{-1,0,1}.$
